Idle Game is a simple game where the player starts with no money and no power in a small nation surrounded by three larger nations. Here the user is only able to take out a free newspaper ad, which is where our game starts. As the players ad runs, they will begin to accrue units, which ad to there total power. Once certain power requirements are met they will unlock the ability to have their army do certain actions gaining the player money.

<----------------TABS---------------->

There are five tabs available to the user.

=== RESOURCES ===

The Resouces tab is always on the left of the user's screen and shows the player's current power and money as well as the player's current army size.

=== RECRUIT ===

The Recruit tab contains methods to gain troops. Troops added to the player's army directly add power. The primary cost of actions in this tab is money.

=== ARMY ===

The Army tab contains actions the player can have their army do to generate money. These actions require a certain amount of power to unlock before you can have your army do them. 

=== UPGRADES ===

The Upgrades tab includes upgrades the player can purchase to increase their power or money output.

=== MAP ===

The Map tab shows the current map of the world. Here the player can see what areas are under their control. The map tab also allows the player to go to war with other nations, should they meet the power requirements.

<----------------VICTORY---------------->

The player wins the game when they take the final Nation.
